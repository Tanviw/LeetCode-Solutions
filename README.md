### #167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

#####LeetCode Link:
[https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

#####Problem description:

 Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
Output: index1=1, index2=2

### #169. Majority Element

#####LeetCode Link:
[https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

#####Problem description:

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
